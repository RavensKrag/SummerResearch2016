this directory is structured like a ruby gem, and holds all the code that pertains to the server

notable exception:
	The code to run the main data model is in the 'catalog_scraper' directory,
	which branches off from the root of the entire overarching project.

	ie, 'catalog_scraper' is structured as a separate gem
