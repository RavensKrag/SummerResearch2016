plan to download all relevant data,
without having to download literally everything



download all college of science data
	(Everyone has to take math and science, want to analyze Bio (and maybe Chem?) in particular)
download all volgeneu school data

download all data relevant to Mason Core
	honors college
	"Mason Core" labeled core lists
	
	(not full departments this time, just sets of classes)
	(need to download the full list of each department's class offerings, but only need to download the specific course data for relevant classes)


download Psychology major data (College of Humanities and Social Sciences)













TODO: chunk all department codes by college / department
	want to see which courses are more likely to be interrelated with others.
	assuming that majors in a particular college are more similar than ones in disparate colleges.
		
		This is not totally true for the same reason that species in a phylogenitic tree
		are not always similar, even if they are placed close together on the tree:
		
		The organizational structure is only a human best guess. It will change over time.



if you go into the individual data for each course in the catalog,
the catalog will tell you what department is offering a specific course

(I just did it manually, because I just wanted a rough overview)











create columns for each dept code that you may want to find
create rows for each year

tick a cell at each intersection to show when dept is valid for that year

output this in excel spreadsheet using roo ?


(much lower noise, much easier to see what departments are offered when)
(could even colorize at this stage)
