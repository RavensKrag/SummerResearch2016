notes on BeautifulSoup4:
.contents returns a list
.children returns interator (same content)
.descendants is a full tree traversal



=== program overview page ===
outer div with a bunch of divs inside it
	heading
	actual list of requiremnts (divided into many sub-sections)
	total number of credits
	honors program
	change of major
	etc
	
	
when examining the CS requriments: (seems to work for both CS and ACS)
list(requirements.children)[0] # header
list(requirements.children)[1] # main requirements
                               # (many divs inside here that break doc into sections)
list(requirements.children)[2] # total number of credits

list(requirements.children)[3] # each div from here on out has an h2 element with a title,
                               #  and some text



in the main div list:
	.acalog-core is the main stuff
	the other ones with inline style "padding-left: 20px" are notes etc
	(they aren't structurally under their "parent" elements, but visually and conceptually there is a clear parent-child relationship)
	



ok, to list this in a more robust way:
h2: "Degree Requirements"
* 
* one or more divs and their subcontainers that list course requirements
* (probably want to keep this tree-like structure)
* 
h2: line listing the total number of credits (CS says "Total: " Bio BA says "Degree Total: ")
* zero or more extra sections listing additional notes etc






ohhh this is weird
this document has many anchor tags <a>
that are not actually hyperlinks.
They are there so that you could add #foo at the end of the URL to jump to anchor "foo"
